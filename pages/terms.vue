            <p><strong>9.2&nbsp;</strong>For purposes of this agreement, “Force Majeure&nbsp;Event” means, with respect to the Nonperforming&nbsp;Party, any event or circumstance, regardless of&nbsp;whether it was foreseeable or not, that was not&nbsp;caused by the Nonperforming Party and that&nbsp;prevents the Nonperforming Party from complying&nbsp;with any of its obligations under this agreement,&nbsp;provided that such Nonperforming Party uses&nbsp;reasonable efforts to do so.</p>
            <p><strong>9.3&nbsp;</strong>Upon occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the&nbsp;Nonperforming Party shall promptly notify the other&nbsp;party of occurrence of that Force Majeure Event, its&nbsp;effect on performance, and how long that the&nbsp;Nonperforming Party expects it to last. Thereafter&nbsp;the Nonperforming Party shall update that&nbsp;information as reasonably necessary.

            <p>The Rules for Expedited Arbitrations shall apply,&nbsp;unless the SCC in its discretion determines, taking&nbsp;into account the complexity of the case, the amount&nbsp;in dispute and other circumstances, that the&nbsp;Arbitration Rules shall apply. In the latter case, the&nbsp;SCC shall also decide whether the Arbitral Tribunal&nbsp;shall be composed of one or three arbitrators. &nbsp;The seat of arbitration shall be Stockholm. The&nbsp;language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall&nbsp;be English.</p>
